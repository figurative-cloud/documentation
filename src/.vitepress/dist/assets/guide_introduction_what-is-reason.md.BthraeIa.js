Basically, Reason AI takes your IaC configuration, your database, serverless functions and more, and puts them together to form a hub that can handle multiple kinds of user queries</p><div class="note custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">NOTE</p><p>Want to try it now?

Here are a few that we are excited about:</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Report generation:</strong></p><p>Use Reason functions to feed your data into the API, tell it how you want the results and voila! You have a working reporting endpoint without writing any code</p></li><li><p><strong>Chat applications:</strong></p><p>Reason&#39;s API supports threaded responses and streaming that can be used to track conversations. This can be used to power your custom chatbot when combined with custom data training using files, web links or questions</p></li><li><p><strong>Contact forms:</strong></p><p>You can use Reason AI to submit contact forms, categorise the response, store it in the appropriate database and send out lead emails, all from a single API endpoint, while taking advantage of AI capabilities available to you</p></li><li><p><strong>Request chaining:</strong></p><p>Want to perform a long series of requests? Use a Reason API is the center stage, connect the various functions and write out the steps to complete the whole flow. Reason will call out each function, using its data to call the next and then return the results in text or JSON format</p></li></ul><h2 id="why-use-reason-api" tabindex="-1">Why use Reason API <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-use-reason-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why use Reason API&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Reason AI promises a single interface to interact with your data. An interface that includes access to the best AI models, all cloud providers as well as your custom data while reducing development time</p><p>Reason AI seeks to deliver on the premise of an LLM OS, where tokens and context windows become the new compute and memory. Join the AI cloud revolution and take advantage of built in features including:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Automatic request logging</em></strong> using threads that keep track of user requests, and responses without extra code</li><li><strong><em>Generative error reporting and logging</em></strong> done on the fly just by connecting external storage function</li><li><strong><em>Built in alarms and notifications</em></strong> sent by Reason AI when specific issues are encountered</li><li><strong><em>Generative or prepared translations</em></strong> to customize responses sent to different customers</li><li><strong><em>Analytics tracking</em></strong> done by passing extra information to the API</li></ul><h2 id="built-by-developers-for-developers" tabindex="-1">Built by developers, for developers <a class="header-anchor" href="#built-by-developers-for-developers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Built by developers, for developers&quot;">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>Reason AI is built from the ground up to make for a seamless dev experience.
